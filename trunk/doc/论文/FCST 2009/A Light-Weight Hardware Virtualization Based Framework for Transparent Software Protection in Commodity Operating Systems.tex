Commodity operating systems are usually large and complex, leading
host-based security tools often provide inadequate protection
against malware because execution environment for software is
untrusted. As a result, most software currently uses various ways to
defend malware attacks. However, these approaches not only raise the
complexity of the software but also fail to offer an engrained
security solution. The focal point in the software protection battle
is how to protect effectively versus how to conceal the protector
from untrusted OSes. This paper describes a lightweight, transparent
and flexible architecture framework called HBSP (Hypervisor Based
Software Protector) for software protection. HBSP, which is based on
hardware virtualization extension technology such as Intel VT, and
by taking advantage of Memory-Hiding strategy, resides completely
outside of the target OS environment.  Our security analysis and the
performance experiment results demonstrate that HBSP effectively
protects applications running on unmodified Windows XP, while the
total overhead is only 0.25\% in average.

\section{Introduction}


Nowadays, commodity operating systems are deployed every corner in
the house, office, and government, managing various commercial
software on them. Unfortunately, most of the OSes cannot provide
adequate security and software protection due to the design and
hardware limitation. Therefore, nearly all the commercial software
needs to implement its own additional protection module, which
raises the total cost on software development.

Current approaches of software protection can be separated into two
categories \cite{IEEEhowto:1}. One is to implement both static and
dynamic code validation through the insertion of objects into the
generated executable, such as watermarking and software birthmark
[2, 3]. The other, more radical, method is to protect software with
hardware supporting \cite{IEEEhowto:20}. The target program is
divided into various parts which run in an encrypted form on secure
coprocessors.

Nevertheless, the risk of attacking the target software still exists
for the following reasons: first, hardware architecture protection
is limited. Hardware architecture defines that the code running in
the privileged mode owns system-wide access to the resources, while
the code in the user mode can only access a limit
range\cite{IEEEhowto:21}. So once the malicious code or analyzing
tools are running in the privileged mode, no more powerful mode can
be used to restrict it.

Second, bugs and debugging functions in the OSes are inevitable. The
kernel and the $\text3^\text{rd}$ party device drivers of the OS
contain millions of lines of code\cite{IEEEhowto:7}. Meanwhile,
nearly all the commodity OSes provide tools to observe other
processes' address space and attach a thread to each process for
debug use. In such cases, there is no way to stop someone who
intends to crack commercial software.

The growing popularity of hardware virtualization motivates our
new solution for software protection. Previous efforts address to
retrofit a trusted execution environment on commodity system by
separating malicious code and system kernel in isolated VMs [9,
10, 11], or using active monitor to handle security sensitive
behaviors [12, 14]. However, these approaches pose a substantial
barrier to adoption as their low performance or critical
requirement of modification to application code or system kernel.

%In this paper, we demonstrate a \emph{transparent, external}
%approach to software protection. Unlike the priors, our design
%requires no code modification of the existing operating systems or
%adding additional hardware. Even the control flow between the
%application and the OS kernel remains unchanged. HBSP makes use of
%Intel VT to create a transparent execution environment instead of
%employing in-guest components or partial/full system virtualization.
%Additionally, Memory-Hiding technology makes it feasible for
%hypervisor to conceal itself in a private memory region. As a
%consequence, the hypervisor is able to run transparently under the
%commodity OSes, while keeping the ability of monitoring the target
%application's execution and state.

Our work represents the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item A lightweight framework with least temporal and spatial
overhead of the communication between the guest OS and hypervisor as
our experiment results revealed. The hypervisor implemented on which
requires no code modification to the existing OS.\item
Implementation of a transparent memory-protecting mechanism which
takes advantage of hardware virtualization and Memory-Hiding
technology offering protection to hypervisor by memory remapping,
thus makes it feasible to conceal the hypervisor in a private memory
region.\item Description of the flexibility and extensibility of
HBSP which offers a rich set of interfaces for configuration as well
as being compatible with other hardware virtualization platform.
\end{itemize}

The following section presents the design goals of HBSP. In section
3, we explain the framework implementation and the challenges when
introducing in Memory-Hiding. Section 4 describes an example to
protect software with the help of HBSP framework in detail. Section
5 shows how we apply our implementation to a default installation of
the Windows XP and evaluates the overall performance. Section 6
reviews related work. Finally we will conclude the ideas in section
7.

\bigskip

\section{Design Goals}
Hardware Enabled Virtualization (HEV) technology can be adopted as
a way of software defense [7, 8, 14]. Our motivation is to offer
another line of software protection even on an untrusted
environment while keeping external and transparent to existing
software, as well as being adopted easily. As a result, we build
the lightweight HBSP with the following advantages:

{\bf\emph {Install/Uninstall on the fly}} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em
minus 0.4em\relax The key idea of HBSP is to load the host OS into a
VM at runtime. By install/uninstalling hypervisor on the fly, it is
much easier to use and debug the hypervisor, while not affecting the
legacy OS and application's integrity, as well as the user
experience.


{\bf\emph {Flexible Configuration}} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax In order to support various ways to protect software,
HBSP supplies a rich set of interfaces to configure Virtual Machine
Control Structure (VMCS) and memory strategy. Hypervisor can be
configured at both the compile time and the runtime. However, it's
not advised to keep all sensitive content in hypervisor for
performance reasons.

{\bf\emph {Support for other HEV technology}} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em
minus 0.4em\relax Currently HBSP supports Intel VT technology. Other
technologies such as AMD SVM are also largely adopted in the market.
To minimize the cost when refactoring the hypervisor to support
these platforms, we build a layer to hide the hardware details.
Hence, extending hypervisor platform support will not affect other
components.

\bigskip

\section{system implementation}
It is challenging to implement the HBSP running on unmodified
commodity OSes. In this section, we firstly describe the HBSP
architecture, and then introduce its control flow and how it
controls the guest OS. The analysis and implementation of
Memory-Hiding technology will be discussed at the end of this
section.

\subsection{HBSP Architecture}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig1.png}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf HBSP Architecture} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax HBSP consists of three layers. User defined hypervisor
will be placed in the top layer, with the help of the HBSP
Services and the HBSP Interfaces. } \label{Figure 1.}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 presents the HBSP architecture. Tailored from BluePill
Project \cite{IEEEhowto:5} and migrated on to the x86 platform to
expand its usage scope, HBSP is divided into three layers: Platform
Related Layer, HBSP Interfaces and $\text3^\text{rd}$ Hypervisor
Layer.

{\bf\emph{Platform Related Layer}} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax   This layer is used to mask implementation differences
among HEV technologies (e.g. HEV-related instructions, checking
platform, VMCS configurations, etc) and provide unique interfaces to
upper layers. In Platform Related Layer, HBSP requires
implementation of HEV technology supporting the following routines,
listed in Table 1 (Since HBSP is tailored from BluePill Project, we
keep most of the procedure names and some function implementations).


\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
\item {ArchIsHvmImplemented() \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax This procedure checks if a hardware platform supports
HEV technology.} \item {ArchInitialize() \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax This procedure takes the responsibility of initializing
the hypervisor and guest machine, it can also enter the VMM if
needed.} \item {ArchVirtualize() \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax This routine is responsible for starting the guest
machine. As a result, the original OS is put into the virtual
machine and continue executing instructions with no sense to the
underlying hypervisor.} \item {ArchDispatchEvent() \hskip 1em plus
0.5em minus 0.4em\relax This function dispatches events to the
proper handler. It is invoked under the following condition: the
hypervisor is using the Default Event Handler supplied in HBSP and a
\#VMEXIT event is occurred in virtual machine.}
\end{itemize}
\fi

\begin{table}[!t]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



{\bf\emph{HBSP Interfaces}} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em\relax
HBSP exports a set of interfaces called \emph{Strategy} to meet the
requirement on the framework's behavior and resource management from
hypervisor developer. For instance, with respect to Memory Strategy
Interfaces, in order to allocate memory for future use, the Platform
Related Layer calls proper functions declared in this set of
interfaces. If Memory Hiding Strategy is used as the definition of
the current memory strategy, HBSP always uses its private page table
to allocate memory for the caller. Besides, by default, the Default
Memory Strategy delegates all the memory management tasks to Windows
system.

{\bf\emph{$\text3^\text{rd}$ Hypervisor Layer}} \hskip 1em plus
0.5em minus 0.4em\relax This layer is concentrated on implementing
customized hypervisor logic. Building on top of HBSP Interfaces, it
supplies services and default HBSP Interfaces implementation to
accelerate constructing a hypervisor. By default, the build-in HBSP
Services mainly include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Default Memory Management \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax HBSP supports two memory management strategies by
default. The Default Memory Strategy uses the Windows kernel API to
manage the hypervisor's code and data memory. Thus, any allocation
and deallocation to this address space can be detected by other
processes. In contrast, the Memory-Hiding Strategy is dedicated to
keep the hypervisor out of the view of guest OS; see Section 3.3 for
details.

\item Default Event Handler \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax This is used to register a callback function with the
indicated \#VMEXIT Reason. For the performance optimization, each
\#VMEXIT Reason is linked to an independent event handler chain,
cutting down the total time spending in the hypervisor via limiting
the length of the chain.
\end{itemize}

Currently, HBSP is designed to support only one guest machine at the
moment, though a typical hypervisor can support more virtual
machines as a nature. Regardless the amount of guest VMs, HBSP
offers a new approach in protecting software. It brings in a
valuable layer of protection, and requires no change to the hardware
and the operating system.

\subsection{HBSP Control Flow}
Since HBSP is based on HEV technology, it plays a role as guest
machine controller between the guest machines and the physical
hardware. Considering a single guest machine running on the top
layer, at any time, the whole system can be in only one context
among the following three types: guest application (Ring 3), guest
kernel (Ring 0/1) and hypervisor (VMM). Both the hypervisor
interested events and the ones which should not be handled in the
guest machine will be transferred to hypervisor and activated.
Later, hypervisor transfers control back to the guest machine
explicitly after it finishes handling the events.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig2.png}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Basic State Transition Diagram}} \label{Figure 2.}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure 2, both guest user mode instructions and guest
kernel mode instructions are capable to trigger hardware to generate
\#VMEXIT events and then transfer control to the hypervisor. For
example, when a guest application executes the CPUID instruction, a
\#VMEXIT event is generated and hardware activates the hypervisor
automatically to handle the event (Transition 1). The hypervisor
examines the stored guest machine state to determine how to handle
it properly, then uses VMX instructions to force hardware to resume
the execution of guest machine and transfer the control back to the
guest machine (Transition 2).

Guest kernel has more chances to trap into the hypervisor. It is
possible the case that a guest machine always triggers \#VMEXIT
event once to read MSR registers if and only if the hypervisor is
configured to monitoring RDMSR instructions with the help of HBSP.
Then the hypervisor does the same handling process as that with
application (Transition 3, 4).

HBSP also supports intercepting the guest machine on accessing
physical resources such as I/O related instructions. A hypervisor
mediating between guest machine and physical hardware can always
perform additional operations on the I/O access (Transition 5, 6)
before resuming to the guest machine. With such approach, a
hypervisor can cheat the malicious kernel and software to protect
applications.

\subsection{Memory-Hiding Technology}
A hypervisor is vulnerable if it can be accessed from the guest OS.
To improve the approach of hypervisor based software protection,
Memory-Hiding technology is applied to conceal the hypervisor
completely. In this section, we firstly describe the conventional
transparency limitation, then analyze the implementation of
Memory-Hiding technology and show its effectiveness after the
hypervisor is turned on.

A typical commodity OS needs to build and manage process page tables
for address translation. Consequently, the mapping from the
hypervisor's virtual address  (VA) to real physical address
(PA$_\text{real}$) is created as {P(VA, PA$_\text{real}$) in the
system page table, as shown in Figure 3. Being accessible from the
guest OS, a hypervisor can be easily invalidated in the face of a
malicious kernel.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig3.png}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Translation without Memory-Hiding.} \hskip 1em plus
0.5em minus 0.4em\relax The space of hypervisor can be accessed
even if the hypervisor itself is running under the guest machine.}
\label{Figure 3.}
\end{figure}


Memory-Hiding technology patches the indicated PTE in the guest OS's
page table. It clones the current page table for private usage, and
then changes the mapping from P(VA, PA$_\text{real}$) in the
hypervisor own address space to $\text{P}^{'}$(VA,
PA$_\text{spare}$), where PA$_\text{spare}$ refers to the physical
address of a special spare page. This strategy makes all access to
the hypervisor be swept out from the patched page table. As shown in
Figure 4, when the execution context switches to hypervisor, the
private page table takes effect and the hypervisor can reference
itself. Once leaving the hypervisor context, the patched page table
with mapping of $\text{P}^{'}$(VA, PA$_\text{spare}$) will be
enabled automatically by hardware, making the hypervisor obscure
again.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig4.png}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Translation Procedure with Memory-Hiding.}}
\label{Figure 4.}
\end{figure}

We make no attempt to let the Memory-Hiding technology support PAE
mode in current system, though it is a promotional functionality
and not hard to implement.

\bigskip

\section{Case Study: Protecting Software with HBSP}
In order to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of HBSP, we
develop a simple hypervisor called \emph{SNProtector} to store the
application's serial key validation algorithm and registration
state. Our protection goal is: even the source code of the
application field is publicly known, the application still remains
protected as long as the SNProtector hypervisor is active.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig5.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf SNProtector Design and Usage Model.}} \label{Figure
5.}
\end{figure}

Figure 5 illustrates the design and usage model of SNProtector. To
fulfill the protection goal, it is important to use Memory-Hiding
Strategy to conceal its code and data segment and render guest OS
imperceptible. Thus, it is hard for an attacker to find out and lock
the registration state in the hypervisor space in that the hidden
pages are never referenced in the guest OS's virtual space.

It's also vital to realize that the conventional way of protecting
software using serial key is weak because it merely verifies the
serial key for only once. To address this problem, SNProtector sets
up a timer simulator, which will be triggered to verify the
registration state in the hypervisor field after a fixed amount of
CR3 switches. A better choice of adopting VMX Preemption Timer is
omitted here due to the limited hardware support temporarily.
Nevertheless, the design reliably renders attackers impossible to
find out which instruction exactly causes the timer trap into the
SNProtector hypervisor and intercept it on a multi-tasking operating
system like Windows.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
main:
  // if reqire unload hypervisor
  // Reveal hypervisor then exit
  if( reqRevealHypervisor ) {
      RevealHypervisor();
      exit;
  }

  ReadIn(&UserName,&SerialNumber);

  // Hide hypervisor
  // Pass the reg info into hypervisor
  HideHypervisor();
  bRegState = VerifySN(&UserName,
    &SerialNumber);

  // I am Cracker!!!
  // bRegState = TRUE;

  // Output proper info
  if( bRegState )
      RegSuccessful();
  else
      RegFailure();

  // To simulate a real commercial software
  while( bRegState ) {
      printf("WorkWork!\n");
      Sleep(2000);
  }

  exit;
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{{\bf The Protected Software Implementation}}
\label{Figure 10.}
\end{figure}

Figure 6 demonstrates a typical implementation of protected program.
Uncommenting the line \emph{"bRegState = TRUE;"} will crack and lock
the registration state in the application field, while not affecting
that in the hypervisor field. Thus, the tamper behavior is detected
immediately as long as the SNProtector hypervisor is running in the
background. So our approach is effective even in the condition that
the source code of application is public.

Taking performance optimization into account, SNProtector also
stores the registration state in the application field to reduces
the clock cycles at runtime as the application doesn't need to
query the registration state initiatively by means of triggering
traps. Although it costs tens of hundreds of cycles to handle a
VMM trap, the overall performance overhead when applying the
protection is limited.

\bigskip

\section{Experiments and Results}
All experiments were conducted on a desktop computer with an Intel
Core2 Duo E6320 processor and 2GB RAM. SNProtector is installed on
both the processor cores. Windows XP SP3 is selected as the guest
operating system of the testbed.

\end{figure*}

\emph{Microbenchmarks} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em\relax Table
2 highlights the results of microbenchmarks that measure the
overhead of intercepting instruction execution by SNProtector. In
this experiment, the benchmarks exhibited low performance on
executing intercepted instructions on guest machine, nearly 11 times
more cycles needed to handle the interception and relevant events
after loading SNProtector. The reason is that trapping to hypervisor
introduces in overhead due to access VMCS region, so does invoking
the proper callback function.

\emph{Application Benchmarks} \hskip 1em plus 0.5em minus
0.4em\relax Although the microbenchmarks show an unacceptable
result, the performance impact on the real application is
imperceptible. Scaling the performance by measuring the program run
time, Figure 7 and 8 present results from the SPEC CPU2006 integer
suite and float point suite, illustrating that running the
hypervisor only brings in a little overhead. Even the worst
individual benchmark suffers less than 0.9\% performance overhead.

The web server experiment, measuring the throughput bytes per second
(Bps), used the default configuration of APACHE 2.2.11 win32
version. A test website is created with 10 random files, the size of
which varies from 1KB to 8MB. The http\_load tool was set up on a
remote host to generate requests for fetching all of these files
with 100 concurrent connections. The client and server were
connected by a 100Mbps switch. The overhead of running the
SNProtector is 0.55\%. Merged with the overall SPEC benchmarks, the
total overhead to the guest machine is 0.25\% in average.

\bigskip

\section{related work}
HEV technology enables transparent intercepting guest OS exceptions
and interrupts. One example is Overshadow\cite{IEEEhowto:6}, which
also can be implemented by HBSP. With the help of additional layer
of address translation, it provides different views of the sensitive
application's address space according to the current context.
Without affecting the existing OS and legacy protected application,
even the hardware, kernel and other programs can only get the
encrypted content from the protected application's virtual space.
Considering only instruction interception at the moment, the
performance of SNProtector is much higher than Overshadow
comparatively.

Many previous systems have attempted to provide a higher-assurance
execution environment by means of building separate VMs.
Proxos\cite{IEEEhowto:12} runs its protected applications in
trusted VMs, with the ability of using the resource in the
untrusted VM. Similarly, iKernel\cite{IEEEhowto:13} improves the
commodity operating system's reliability and security by isolating
the buggy and malicious device drivers running on separate virtual
machine. To establish a configurable trust between applications
and operating systems, partition system call interface  or
separation of privilege\cite{IEEEhowto:15} is utilized to enable
secure level code running in different VMs. Hypervisor based
monitoring on malicious behaviors [12, 14] is used to handle
certain security sensitive instructions. Focusing on the similar
design goal, our approach excels at higher performance and less
affect to legacy OS kernel on account of the optimized design.
Proxos \cite{IEEEhowto:12} requires code modification to both
application and the kernel. While Igor Burdonov's work
\cite{IEEEhowto:15}, Ether \cite{IEEEhowto:16} and Lares
\cite{IEEEhowto:18} pose a high performance penalty and iKernel
\cite{IEEEhowto:13} hasn't range its experiment statistics on
temporal overhead test.

Intel's Trusted Execution Technology\cite{IEEEhowto:17} is another
hardware-based software security approach, providing isolated
protected execution environment, which offers no privilege to
unauthorized software even to observe. Furthermore, it provides
protected input and storage channel to ensure the data security.
This approach can be regarded as a complement of our Memory-Hiding
technology, albeit only available on some special hardware.

\bigskip

\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented the architecture and design of
HBSP, which can be used to implement external hypervisor running
transparently under the guest OS and intercepting indicated guest
machine actions without modifying existing OS and hardware, even
software.

Memory-Hiding is entitled by patching the page table of guest OS
while holding a real one in the hypervisor. This causes some
anti-debug tools and hypervisor detect tools invalid in the face of
HBSP. Thus it constructs a safer execution environment for
customized hypervisor layer software protector.

As a prototype implementation, we build a simple serial key
protector using HBSP. A series of experiments on Windows OS have
proven that our approach introduces little overhead to the existed
environment. We believe that HBSP is a practical approach to protect
software in commodity operating systems.
